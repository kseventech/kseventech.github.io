# Intro 

## Project types

In my current experience as a software engineer, creating a software project requires implementation of one or many of the following applications:

- Frontend applications (Website, Web application)
- Backend applications (Web server, API)
- iOS applications
- Android applications

## Roles

The are a few key roles required for creating a software project:

- Management
- Development
- Operations

Management is responsible for understanding what needs to be created, and organizing the work required for this software to be implemented.

Development is responsible for understanding the organization that management provides, and implementing the software itself.

Operations is responsible for supporting development by providing the required environment for the implemented software and handling of the deployment processes.

## Methodology

The common principle in creating software is using the agile methodology.  
In shortest words the idea is to  
> deliver incrementaly, not at once

For management, that means rounding up required work into deliverable chunks which produce, at a time, incomplete but functional application. With each chunk, application grows in features, and in the end becomes the final product. 

For development, that means implementing the software with assumption that each change must be producing a deployable application. 

For operations, that means creating working environments that support deploying these applications in their various stages in an automated fashion. 

## DevOps

For successful realization of agile software projects, the gap between development and operations must be bridged with combination of philosophies, practices and tools commonly refered to as DevOps.
