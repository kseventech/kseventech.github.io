# Rules

#### 1. Contribute through PRs
Anyone with a write access to the repository is able to contribute to the knowledge base by submitting a PR.  
Maintainers review those PRs and merge them into the main branch.

#### 2. Follow formatting rules
Badly formatted documents will not be accepted.  
Try to use as much of the Markdown's features as possible (header levels, accenting...).  
Keep the knowledge base free from clutter and easy to navigate through.

#### 3. Don't post sensitive information
Documents shouldn't contain any sensitive information as all content is publicly visible.

#### 4. Improve other people's docs 
Improving other people's documents is allowed and encouraged.   
If you think something is wrong, something has been explained in a bad way, or you just have the better words, feel free to create a PR.  
Make sure to @mention the original author and check whether the changes are acceptable.
