# Git hosts

Git hosts such (as Github or Gitlab) are mainly used as remote counterpart for project git repositories.   
Apart from that, they are used for various other tools such as issue tracking, pull/merge requests, CI/CD etc.

## Github

As a primary hosting platform, I decided that we should be using **Github** due to following:

- Almost everyone has Github accounts already and is used to that interface
- There is an option to create organization within Github
- Developer accounts can just be added as members of the organization which manages all repositories

Github organization for K7 Tech company is [ kseventech ]( https://github.com/kseventech ).

## Gitlab

When projects require CI/CD, Gitlab is a go-to platform.   
Gitlab doesn't have an option to create an organization, so we are using dedicated account instead.  
Gitlab manages access control with Groups.  

Gitlab acount for K7 Tech company is [ kseventech ]( https://gitlab.com/kseventech ).
